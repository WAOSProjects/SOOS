## Description

Soos is an open source web tool developed at the Data Lab based on the tool RAW to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing d3.js library. Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, Soos aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, OpenRefine) and vector graphics editors (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, ...).

## Installation

* Node v5.7.0 max, mongo 3.x
